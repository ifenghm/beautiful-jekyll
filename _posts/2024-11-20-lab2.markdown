## World Bank Data API

### Making API requests

- The default data from the World Bank API comes in XML format. So I added the `format=json` parameter to the query string to get the data in JSON format. The default number of results per page is 50. To get more results, I added the `per_page=1000` parameter to the query string.
- That doesn't guarantee I get full coverage though, so I wrote a recursive function that keeps making requests until it reaches the last page (using the `page=#` parameter) for a given indicator.
  
```python
def get_world_bank_data(indicator, page=1):
    # Make a GET request to the World Bank API to figure out how many pages there are
    response = requests.get(f"{URL}/?format=json&page={page}&per_page=1000")
    json = response.json()  # 0 is the metadata, 1 is the data
    page_total = json[0]["pages"]
    # load the data into classes

    if page == page_total:
        print(f"Last page for indicator {indicator} reached.")
    else:
        return get_world_bank_data(indicator, page + 1)
```

Lots of the data goes back to the 1940s, and there seems to be 294 "countries" (huh? I'll look into this later), so there are 23k data points.

### Indicators

There are over [24,000 indicators](https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/898599-indicator-api-queries) in the World Bank API. Holy smokes. After doing some preliminary checks, I wanted to focus on **Health** and **Wealth**, and if there was a relationship between the two.

Health indicators:

1. Pollution
2. Immunizations
3. Life expectancy

Wealth indicators:

1. GDP (per capita)
2. [GINI index](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.GINI?end=2023&most_recent_value_desc=true&start=1963&view=chart&year=2014)

#### 1. Population vs GDP

- 1.5k data points from 2000-2018
- I chose to filter out for these years because I think COVID impacted GDP weirdly, and 2000 was indeed a bit arbitrary, but wanted to think about the modern era.
- **Negative** relationship: As population increases, GDP goes up

When I hit the API
```javascript
{'p_value': 5.773159728050814e-14, 'slope': 4.714468621599472e-05}
```

I removed outliers (countries with under 10 million pop and over 1 billion pop)
The slope is so small that it's not worth considering that there is a relationship. 
In any case though, it was helpful for me to learn how to filter out things using **pandas**. 

```python
# Filter out years between two values
df['year'] = df['year'].astype(int)
df = df[df['year'].between(2000, 2019)]
```

#### 2. GDP and Life Expectancy

Let's see if we can generate a significant relationship.
I think there's an obvious relationship between "wealthier countries are healthier countries".
We can prove that by calculating the difference between GDP and life expectancy. I think there is a positive relationship between the two.

- There are 10k data points from 200 countries, from 1960-2020
- **Positive** relationship: As GDP increases, life expectancy goes up (only by .00036 years though)

```javascript
{'p_value': 0.0, 'slope': 0.00036210467335729313}
```

This slope is again pretty small though it is better from the previous indicator. I want to generate some more obvious correlations to see if I can get a better slope.

#### 3a. Population vs Air Pollution

- 6k data points from 1990-2020, 30 yrs
- The tiniest positive relationship

P-value for independent variable:
```javascript
{'p_value': 0.0026544868824140977, 'slope': -2.3427729539272174e-08}
```

Bleh again.

#### 3b. Pollution and Pollution Deaths

Because I got a non-significant relationship between population and GDP, and the tiniest positive relationship between population and air pollution, I wanted to choose two indicators that would be much more obviously related and make sure this was significant. I chose pollution and pollution deaths. The maps looked pretty similar, so I was hoping for a strong relationship.

![Pollution Deaths]({{ "/assets/img/unit2/pollution_deaths.png" | absolute_url }})
![Air Pollution]({{ "/assets/img/unit2/pollution.png" | absolute_url }})

Air pollution, measured in micrograms per cubic meter, was collected in the Global Burden of Disease Study from 1990-2019, with an indicator name of [EN.ATM.PM25.MC.M3](
https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.PM25.MC.M3?end=2020&most_recent_value_desc=true&start=1990&type=shaded&view=map)
 
Pollution deaths [SH.STA.AIRP.P5](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.STA.AIRP.P5?end=2019&most_recent_value_desc=true&start=2019&type=shaded&view=map) was collected by the WHO and we only have 2019 data from 185 countries, so glad there was an overlap here.

Yep, it is very clear that there is a relationship. For every 1 more microgram of air pollution per cubic meter, the mortality rate (per 100k people) due to air pollution increases by 2.4 people.

```javascript
{'p_value': 6.290745702131062e-12, 'slope': 2.4413200940047437}
```

#### 3c. Pollution and Life expectancy

I wanted to see if there was a relationship between pollution and life expectancy.
There are nearly 6k data points here. There is a negative relationship, as I expected. 
The more pollution, the life expectancy decreases by .21 years.

```javascript
{'p_value': 0.0, 'slope': -0.2134299228149387}
```

#### 4. Immunizations vs Life expectancy

I wanted to see if there was a relationship between immunizations and life expectancy.
I thought there would be a positive relationship, unlike RFK Kennedy jr.

These immunizations were for 3 diseases: HepB, Diptheria, and Measles. I just averaged them.

```javascript
{'p_value': 0.0, 'slope': 0.2847277540567132}
```

There is a slight positive relationship, and it's significant.
For every 1% increase in immunization rates, life expectancy of a country increases by 0.28 years.
The correlation is .66, which is the highest correlation so far. I'm not sure if I'm convincing anyone else in this class that vaccines are good, though.

#### 5. GINI and Life Expectancy

I have a suspicion that there is a negative relationship between GINI and life expectancy. 
I think that the more unequal a country is, the lower the life expectancy.
This is because even if the healthcare is good, the poor are not able to access that good healthcare.

The GINI index doesn't seem to be as updated for that many countries, so there are only 2.1k data points here. 

The GINI is a measure of from [0 to 100](https://databank.worldbank.org/metadataglossary/gender-statistics/series/SI.POV.GINI) where 0 implies perfect equality and 100 implies perfect inequality. 
A measure of 100 would be if only 1 individual owned 100% of the income. 

```javascript
{'p_value': 0.0, 'slope': -0.32566992458381117}
```

So for the share of the income being more unequal by 1 point,
life expectancy decreases by 0.3257 years.
The correlation is -.36, which is not that strong though,
so I think this may be due to outlier countries (high GINI, high life expectancy).
Or maybe it's true that low GINI == high life expectancy, but high GINI == still some higher life expectancy as well,
because richer people will live longer and increase life expectancy anyway. It could be some parabola-shaped relationship

### Discussions, Doubts

Surprisingly, I all had low p-values and therefore all these correlations are statistically significant.
However, many of them had very small slopes, so they could be "spurious" correlations.
I think the most convincing correlation was between immunizations and life expectancy, with a correlation of .66. 
Of course, some of you may not know about correlation yet but we will learn about it soon! :)
