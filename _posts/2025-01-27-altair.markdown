Altair is a python wrapper around vega-lite. You can create a vega-lite chart in python and then export it to a json file. You can then use vega-embed to insert the chart into any webpage.

## 1. Save your chart to a json file

I assume you've already created a chart in Altair. Make sure you save your chart to a variable. 

```python
chart = alt.Chart(data).mark_point().encode(
    # ... your channels here
)
```

You can use the `to_json()` method to save your chart to a json file.

```python
chart.save('chart.json')
```

## 2. Upload the json file to your github repository

You can upload the json file to your github repository. Make sure you get the raw link to the file. i.e., you click the 'raw' button so you're not viewing the file on github but rather just the text itself. For example, the github **website** link to my json is: [https://github.com/ifenghm/beautiful-jekyll/blob/master/code/unit4/interactive_altair_us_employment.json](https://github.com/ifenghm/beautiful-jekyll/blob/master/code/unit4/interactive_altair_us_employment.json) and the raw link to that same file is [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ifenghm/beautiful-jekyll/refs/heads/master/code/unit4/interactive_altair_us_employment.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ifenghm/beautiful-jekyll/refs/heads/master/code/unit4/interactive_altair_us_employment.json).

## 3. Insert the chart into your webpage

You can use the following code to insert the chart into your webpage, I found this code snippet from the [vega-embed github README](https://github.com/vega/vega-embed?tab=readme-ov-file#directly-in-the-browser). 

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <!-- Import Vega & Vega-Lite (does not have to be from CDN) -->
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega@[VERSION]"></script>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega-lite@[VERSION]"></script>
  <!-- Import vega-embed -->
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega-embed@[VERSION]"></script>
</head>

<div id="vis"></div>

<script type="text/javascript">
  var spec = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vega/vega/master/docs/examples/bar-chart.vg.json";
  vegaEmbed('#vis', spec).then(function(result) {
    // Access the Vega view instance (https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/api/view/) as result.view
  }).catch(console.error);
</script>

</html>
```

1. Copy the above code into your blogpost. You don't need to copy the `<!DOCTYPE html>` and `</html>` tags (first and last lines) since your markdown file is already embedded in an html page. (I also stripped the <body> tag since you can't have more than one in an html document).
2. Please replace where you see `[VERSION]` with the version number of vega, vega-lite, and vega-embed that you want to use. As of this time of writing, you can use `5`, `5`, and `6` respectively.
3. Replace the `spec` variable with the path to your json file.

## 4. Profit!

You should now see your chart in your webpage, and now that your chart is javascript-ified, people can interact with it!

<head>
  <!-- Import Vega & Vega-Lite (does not have to be from CDN) -->
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega@5.31.0"></script>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega-lite@5.23.0"></script>
  <!-- Import vega-embed -->
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega-embed@6.29.0"></script>
</head>
<body>

<div id="vis"></div>

<script type="text/javascript">
  var spec = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ifenghm/beautiful-jekyll/refs/heads/master/code/unit4/interactive_altair_us_employment.json";
  vegaEmbed('#vis', spec).then(function(result) {
    // Access the Vega view instance (https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/api/view/) as result.view
  }).catch(console.error);
</script>
</body>

> NOTE: if you want to use a second chart, you need to create a new div with a unique id and then create a new script tag with a new spec variable. You can't have two charts in one document with the same id. Change both the `vis` objects in `div id="vis"` and `vegaEmbed('#vis', spec)` to `vis2`, or something.
